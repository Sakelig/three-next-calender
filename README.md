-[ ] clicked boxes should update the main site and show number as open for each user? save state locally?
-[x] Each door can now have their own image
-[ ] IMPORTANT! Cut doors to match calender spot and add calender number
-[x] host on aws
-[x] should use my domain adventcalender.sakelig
-[x] APIGATE way with simple go lambda
-[x] frontend should call backend which should call the apigateway endpoint
-[ ] s3 bucket with content
-[ ] lambda gets content from s3 based on request
-[ ] handle new door and content each day
-[ ] security group for amplify and lambda/api gateway
-[x] Need to draw boxes
-[x] Handles images
-[x] Handles videos

# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter

A minimalist starter for NextJS, @react-three/fiber and Threejs.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2223602/192515435-a3d2c1bb-b79a-428e-92e5-f44c97a54bf7.jpg)

- TTL ~ 100ms
- First load JS ~¬†79kb
- Lighthouse score of 100 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time. 3D components are usable anywhere in the dom. The events, dom, viewport, everything is synchronized!

### ‚ö´ Demo :

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default style. styled-components (styled) are also available._

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app
# yarn create r3f-app <next> my-app <tailwind|styled>? -ts?
# npx create-r3f-app next my-app
```

### :passport_control: Typescript

For typescript add the parameter `-ts` or `--typescript`:

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app -ts
# npx create-r3f-app next my-app -ts
```

### :mount_fuji: Features

- [x] GLSL imports
- [x] Canvas is not getting unmounted while navigating between pages
- [x] Canvas components usable in any div of the page
- [x] Based on the App directory architecture
- [x] PWA Support

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Thanks to [tunnel-rat](https://github.com/pmndrs/tunnel-rat) the starter can portal components between separate renderers. Anything rendered inside the `<View/>` component of the starter will be rendered in the 3D Context. For better performances it uses gl.scissor to cut the viewport into segments.

```jsx
<div className='relative'>
  <View orbit className='relative sm:h-48 sm:w-full'>
    <Dog scale={2} />
    // Some 3D components will be rendered here
  </View>
</div>
```

### :control_knobs: Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Next dev
- `yarn analyze` - Generate bundle-analyzer
- `yarn lint` - Audit code quality
- `yarn build` - Next build
- `yarn start` - Next start
